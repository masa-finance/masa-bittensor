## Get Tokens

### Testnet

To get tTAO to register your miner on testnet, head to **[Bittensor's Testnet Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1120750674595024897/1242998080501186620)** channel and request tTAO! You will need to provide your miner's coldkey. You can also head to the **[Masa Discord server](https://discord.gg/HyHGaKhaKs)** and join the **#node-bt** community!

### Mainnet

If running on mainnet, you can purchase TAO from many exchanges, including [Coin Marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bittensor/#Markets) and [Changenow.io](https://changenow.io/?from=eth&to=tao). Copy your wallet's coldkey and send TAO to the address! For now, registration cost is typically around 0.05 TAO. However, keep in mind that subnet registration is a variable cost, so be sure to factor this into your budget. You can check the current registration cost on [TAO Stats](https://x.taostats.io/subnet/42).
