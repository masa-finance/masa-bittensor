title: Welcome to Masa Bittensor Subnet
---

The Masa Bittensor Subnet is a specialized subnet where validators reward miners based on their ability to provide Twitter data. Requests made through the Validator API are forwarded to the miners, who use the Masa protocol to execute the work. Work is then scored by the validators, and valid reponses are returned through the API.

To get started, follow the below documentation depending on what neuron you intend to run:
