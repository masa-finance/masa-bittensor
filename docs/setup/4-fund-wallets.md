## Mint Tokens

Next, mint tokens to your `miner` wallet:

```bash
make fund-miner-wallet
```

When asked for confirmation to run the faucet on network `unknown`, type `y`, and press enter. Confirm your password used to create the wallets, and press enter again. Wait for the tTAO to be minted to your wallet, and repeat the process for your validator wallet:
