### Testnet

If running on testnet, use our **[form](https://forms.gle/ac6CFscdTQz1NNJo7)** to request tTAO! You can also head to the **[Masa Discord server](https://discord.gg/HyHGaKhaKs)** and join the **#node-bt** community!

### Mainnet

If running on mainnet, you can purchase TAO from many exchanges, including [Changenow.io](https://changenow.io/?from=eth&to=tao). Copy your wallet's coldkey and send TAO to the address! For now, registration cost is typically around 0.05 TAO. However, keep in mind that subnet registration is a variable cost, so be sure to factor this into your budget. You can check the current registration cost on [TAO Stats](https://x.taostats.io/subnet/42).
