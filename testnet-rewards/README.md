# Guide to Verify Your Key Ownership

## Step 1: Generate the Proof

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning our company's GitHub repository to access the necessary scripts.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/masa-finance/masa-bittensor/tree/feature/verify-tao-signature
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your directory to where the `generate-proof.py` script is located.
    ```bash
    cd <repository-directory>/testnet-rewards
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the `generate-proof.py` script. You will be prompted to enter your hotkey, Ethereum address, and coldkey name ( This cold key HAS to be associated with the submited hotkey ). Make sure to enter these details accurately.
    ```bash
    python generate-proof.py
    ```

    - **Example Input:**
        - Enter your hotkey: `YourHotkey`
        - Enter your ETH address: `YourEthereumAddress`
        - Enter your coldkey name: `YourColdkeyName`
        - Enter password to unlock key: `[YourColdKeyPassword]`

    - **Output:** This will generate a signature and save it to a file named `message_and_signature.txt`.

4. **Send the Proof File**: Once the script has generated the proof, send the `message_and_signature.txt` file to us via Discord or email.
